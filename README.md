In this project, I will develop and refine a regression model using absolute error as the primary evaluation metric. The first part focuses on fitting the model to the provided dataset and exploring multiple solutions for model fitting. In the second part, I will simulate new data that replicates the original dataset’s behavior and apply the absolute error regression method to analyze its performance. Throughout the project, I will document all steps and modifications, providing detailed comments for clarity. I will also explain how the selected slope and intercept values contributed to successfully replicating the original dataset’s predictions with a comparable absolute error. The goal is to enhance my understanding of absolute error regression and demonstrate the ability to model data effectively through simulation and precise parameter tuning.
